# 🚨 URGENT: Discord Bot Database Connection Issues - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## ❌ Issues Identified from Your Error Logs

Your Unit Talk Discord Bot is failing with these specific errors:

1. **"Failed to load onboarding flows from DB: TypeError: fetch failed"**
2. **"Failed to load onboarding config from DB: TypeError: fetch failed"**
3. **Missing database tables**: `onboarding_flows` and `onboarding_config`

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE FIX - Follow These Steps in Order

### Step 1: Database Setup (CRITICAL - Do This First!)

**Go to your Supabase project dashboard:**
1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `lxqmuzmqtnnlpfapvief`
3. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Copy the ENTIRE contents of `complete-database-setup.sql` (created for you)
5. Paste it into the SQL Editor
6. Click "Run" button
7. Wait for all queries to complete successfully

**This will create all missing tables including:**
- `onboarding_flows` (MISSING - causing your errors!)
- `onboarding_config` (MISSING - causing your errors!)
- `user_profiles`
- `picks`
- And 15+ other required tables

### Step 2: Test Database Connection

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
cd unit-talk-custom-bot
node test-database.js
```

**Windows Command Prompt:**
```cmd
cd unit-talk-custom-bot
node test-database.js
```

You should see:
- ✅ Basic connection successful
- ✅ All required tables exist and accessible

### Step 3: Run the Complete Fix Script

**Option A - PowerShell (Recommended):**
```powershell
cd unit-talk-custom-bot
.\fix-bot.ps1
```

**Option B - Command Prompt:**
```cmd
cd unit-talk-custom-bot
fix-bot.bat
```

**Option C - Manual Steps:**
```cmd
cd unit-talk-custom-bot
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

1. **Missing Database Tables**: Your bot was trying to query `onboarding_flows` and `onboarding_config` tables that didn't exist in your Supabase database.

2. **Incomplete Schema**: The original database setup was missing critical tables that the bot expects.

3. **Network Issues**: The "TypeError: fetch failed" suggests either missing tables or network connectivity issues.

## ✅ Expected Success Output

After running the database setup, your bot should start with:

# 2. Then run these commands:

cd unit-talk-custom-bot
node test-database.js
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If you still get errors after following these steps:

1. **Check the database setup**: Make sure the SQL script ran successfully in Supabase
2. **Verify environment variables**: Ensure your `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials
3. **Test connection**: Run `node test-database.js` to diagnose specific issues
4. **Check network**: Ensure you can access your Supabase project from your server

## 🎯 Root Cause Summary

The bot was failing because it expected database tables (`onboarding_flows`, `onboarding_config`) that didn't exist in your Supabase database. The "TypeError: fetch failed" was occurring because Supabase was returning errors for queries to non-existent tables.

**The solution is to run the complete database setup SQL script to create all required tables.**
