## Current Status
- **Total Issues**: 768 (down from 1,400+ originally)
- **Reduction**: ~45% reduction in total issues
- **Errors**: 576
- **Warnings**: 192

## Progress by Directory

### âœ… Completed (0 issues)
1. **src/utils** - All 6 any types fixed
2. **src/db** - All 9 any types fixed  
3. **src/services** - All 2 any types fixed
4. **src/shared** - All 11 issues fixed (any types + console statements)
5. **src/config** - All 5 console statements fixed
6. **src/types** - All 35 any types fixed
7. **src/middleware** - All 10 issues fixed (any types + console statements)

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
1. **src/agents** - 389 issues (largest remaining directory)

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Directories
- src/commands
- src/handlers  
- src/logic
- src/monitoring
- src/routes
- src/runner
- src/workflows
- Root level files (index.ts, worker.ts, etc.)

## Key Improvements Made

### Type Safety Enhancements
- Replaced 100+ `any` types with `unknown` for better type safety
- Added proper interface definitions for complex objects
- Improved generic type constraints

### Code Quality
- Replaced console statements with proper logger calls
- Fixed consistent-return issues
- Improved error handling patterns

### Files Cleaned
- **Services**: dailyPickPublisher.ts, capperService.d.ts
- **Utils**: config.ts, errorHandling.ts, fetchEdgeConfig.ts, logger.ts, pickEmbeds.ts
- **Database**: All type definition files in src/db/types/
- **Shared**: Complete error handling and logging infrastructure
- **Config**: Environment validation with proper logging
- **Types**: All type definition files
- **Middleware**: Validation and rate limiting with proper typing

## Next Steps
1. Focus on src/agents directory (389 issues)
2. Clean remaining smaller directories
3. Address root level files
4. Final verification and testing

## Impact
- **45% reduction** in total linting issues
- **7 directories** now completely clean
- Significantly improved type safety across the codebase
- Better error handling and logging practices established
