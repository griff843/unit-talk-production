/**
 * VERIFICATION & SIMULATION CONTROL PLANE — RecordingPublishAdapter
 * Sprint: SPRINT-VERIFICATION-SIMULATION-LAYER-R1

 * Captures publish payloads without emitting to Discord or any external endpoint.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - Cannot be instantiated in production mode (throws on construction)
 *   - Never calls any external HTTP endpoint or Discord API
 *   - Returns synthetic receipts with synthetic=true
 *   - Records all attempts for proof inspection
