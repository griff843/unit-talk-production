/**
 * VERIFICATION & SIMULATION CONTROL PLANE — ReplaySettlementAdapter
 * Sprint: SPRINT-VERIFICATION-SIMULATION-LAYER-R2
 *
 * SettlementAdapter implementation for replay mode.
 * Returns historical settlement outcomes from the EventStore.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - Cannot be instantiated in production mode (throws on construction)
 *   - Never calls any live odds or data provider API
 *   - Returns null when no recorded settlement exists for a pickId
 *   - Marks synthetic=true on all returned SettlementData
 *   - Settlement results are immutable (replay never fabricates outcomes)
