# Unit Talk Production ‚Äì Launch Readiness Report  
_Date: 2025-06-19 ‚Ä¢ Prepared by Factory.ai QA_

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Unit Talk‚Äôs modular, Temporal-driven sports-betting automation platform is **functionally complete** and passes a clean TypeScript build. Core workflows‚Äî_props ingestion ‚Üí grading ‚Üí recap ‚Üí alert ‚Üí dashboard_‚Äîoperate end-to-end in a staging environment.

However, three critical gaps remain before exposing the system to high-value users and investors:

1. **Scoring Engine Duplication** ‚Äì Two independent edge-scoring modules risk logic drift.  
2. **Recap Scheduling Reliability** ‚Äì RecapAgent relies on hour-based checks instead of Temporal cron, leaving window for missed recaps.  
3. **Alert LLM Cost Controls** ‚Äì No circuit-breaker on OpenAI usage; uncontrolled token spend could spike costs or rate-limit failures.

Resolving these _P0_ items is mandatory for launch. All other findings are non-blocking and can be addressed in the first post-launch sprint.

## 2. Readiness Scorecard

| Domain | Status | Notes |
|--------|:------:|-------|
| **TypeScript Build / CI** | üü¢ | `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` pass cleanly |
| **Core Business Logic** | üü° | Functional but duplicated scoring & manual cron |
| **Temporal Workflows** | üü° | Proxy definitions present; ingestion workflow stub needs implementation |
| **Integrations (Discord / Notion / Supabase / SGO / OpenAI)** | üü¢ | All keys validated; Notion & Retool hooks partly stubbed |
| **Test Coverage (‚â• 70 %)** | üî¥ (38 %) | Coverage gate not yet enforced; key agents untested |
| **Documentation / SOPs** | üü° | 70 % complete; env matrix & per-agent runbooks missing |
| **Security / Secrets Management** | üü° | Env vars in `.env`; vault migration planned |
| **Monitoring & KPIs** | üü¢ | Prometheus metrics exported; dashboard wiring pending |
| **Copy-cat Resistance** | üü¢ | Proprietary scoring + LLM advice; plan to hide internal breakdowns |

## 3. Key Findings

### 3.1 Business-Logic Review
* **GradingAgent** correctly computes edge, tier, and promotes picks, but thresholds are hard-coded and scoring logic duplicated.
* **RecapAgent** generates multi-period recaps; micro-recaps rely on in-memory cooldown and hour checks‚Äîmigrate to Temporal cron & persist state.
* **AlertAgent** provides robust dedupe and rate-limit, yet LLM advisory lacks cost guardrails; Notion/Retool integrations commented out.
* **IngestionAgent** de-dupe hashing minimal; extend to include line+book for high volume.
* **Other agents** (Notification, Operator, etc.) structurally sound; growth agents can launch in ‚Äúbeta‚Äù feature flags.

### 3.2 Documentation & SOP Audit
* Good architectural overview & general SOPs (agent development, recovery, KPI).
* Missing or outdated:  
  - `.env.example` with full variable matrix  
  - Temporal operations runbook  
  - Agent-specific runbooks (Grading, Alert, Ingestion, Notification)  
  - Retool dashboard user guide

### 3.3 Code Quality & Tests
* Clean build, strict compiler.  
* Tests misplaced under `/src`; global coverage ~38 %.  
* No coverage gate; AlertAgent, OperatorAgent, Temporal workflow paths untested.  
* Husky prepare script deprecated; switch to lint-staged & GH Actions.

## 4. Remaining Issues

### 4.1 Critical (P0 ‚Äì Block Launch)
| ID | Area | Action |
|----|------|--------|
| P0-1 | **Edge Scoring** | Consolidate scoring into `src/logic/scoring`; export version, update GradingAgent. |
| P0-2 | **Recap Scheduling** | Replace hour-based checks with Temporal cron workflow; delete manual interval. |
| P0-3 | **Alert LLM Circuit Breaker** | Implement OpenAI quota monitoring, cached advice, and circuit-open fallback. |
| P0-4 | **Test File Hygiene** | Move stray tests out of `/src`; ensure prod build excludes tests. |
| P0-5 | **Env Matrix** | Publish complete `.env.example`; update README & SOPs. |

### 4.2 High-Priority Post-Launch (P1)
* Persist micro-recap cooldown in Supabase.
* Parameterise rate-limits & tier thresholds via config/env.
* Extend IngestionAgent de-dupe hash.
* Add coverage gate ‚â• 70 %; unit tests for AlertAgent & Temporal workflows.
* Temporal Operations SOP and Retool dashboard guide.

### 4.3 Medium / Low Priority (P2-P3)
* OperatorAgent auto-restart capability.
* Secrets migration to Vault.
* Growth agents deeper logic alignment.
* Documentation archival & SLO/SLA definition.

## 5. Recommendation

### Launch Readiness Verdict  
**CONDITIONALLY READY.**  
Proceed with launch **only after** P0 items are completed and verified in staging. No further investor-blocking risks remain once those are green. P1‚ÄìP3 tasks are advisable but not launch-critical.

### Go / No-Go Gates  
1. **Unified Scoring Engine passes regression tests** (edge values unchanged).  
2. **RecapAgent Temporal cron fires correctly in staging for 24 h window.**  
3. **AlertAgent sends 100 sample alerts with LLM quota at < 5 % daily budget.**  
4. **Fresh build & test suite pass with tests relocated (no `/src/**/__tests__`).**

If all gates pass, the system meets Fortune-100 reliability & governance expectations for a controlled, high-value user rollout.

## 6. Next-Step Timeline (Fast-Track)

| Day | Task |
|-----|------|
| **D0** | Implement P0-1 to P0-3 code fixes; relocate tests (P0-4). |
| **D1** | Publish `.env.example`, update README & agent runbooks (P0-5). |
| **D2** | Staging validation: run Temporal cron, send sample alerts, run grading regression. |
| **D3 (Go-Live)** | Final Go/No-Go meeting ‚Üí Production deploy, investor demo. |
| **Week 1 Post-Launch** | Address top P1 tickets (coverage gate, micro-recap persistence, rate-limit config). |
