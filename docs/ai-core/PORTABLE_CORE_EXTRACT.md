# Portable Core Extraction — Classification Table

**Sprint:** PORTABLE-CORE-EXTRACTION-059A **Date:** 2026-03-16 **Author:**
Claude / Griff

## Purpose

This document records the explicit extraction decision for every AI
operating-system asset in Unit Talk.

For each asset it records:

- Classification (Portable Core / Adapter-Based / Unit Talk-Specific / Deferred)
- Action taken
- Rationale

This is the ground truth for why each asset ended up where it did.

## Part 6 — What Was Deferred

| Asset                                     | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AI_BOOTSTRAP_READINESS_CHECKLIST template | Current UT instance is too status-specific. Template version deferred until first non-UT pilot reveals what's truly reusable.                                                                            |
| Context bundle generation scripts         | UT's `pnpm ai:context` / `build-context-bundle.mjs` is UT-specific in implementation. Pattern is portable but extraction requires real pilot project.                                                    |
| Generic health-check skill template       | Pattern is clear, but building a proper generic version requires knowing what MCP tools exist in target project. Deferred to pilot.                                                                      |
| Generic sprint workflow .claude/rules/    | The `.claude/rules/` directory contains UT-specific governance rules (single-writer, lifecycle, migration). A generic baseline rules set is a good future artifact but requires a pilot to test against. |

## Part 7 — Stability Verification

The following Unit Talk production assets were **NOT modified** in this sprint:

- All files in `docs/ai/` (original copies preserved)
- All files in `.claude/skills/` (no changes)
- All files in `.claude/rules/` (no changes)
- All files in `.claude/agents/` (no changes)
- All application code (`apps/`, `packages/`)
- All governance contracts (`CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md`)

This sprint created new files only. Zero risk to Unit Talk production workflows.
