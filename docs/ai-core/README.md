# AI Portable Core

**Status:** v1 — Extracted 2026-03-16 **Source:** Unit Talk AI Operating System
**Owner:** Griff

## What This Is

This directory contains the **portable AI operating core** — the reusable parts
of the Unit Talk AI workflow system that can be installed into any future
project.

It is the result of a deliberate extraction sprint that separated:

- what is truly reusable across projects
- what requires project-specific adaptation
- what must remain Unit Talk-specific

---

## Three-Layer Architecture

Every AI operating system built from this core has three layers:

```
Portable Core          ← this directory
  +
Project Adapter        ← created per-project (AI_PROJECT_ADAPTER_<NAME>_v1.md)
  +
Project-Specific       ← skills, domain logic, invariants unique to that project
Domain Layer
```

The portable core provides workflow discipline. The adapter teaches the core how
to interpret a specific project. The domain layer holds the local logic that
belongs nowhere else.

## How to Use This in a New Project

**Start here:** `install/INSTALL_GUIDE.md`

The install sequence is:

1. Copy the doctrine docs into your new repo's `docs/ai/` directory
2. Create a project adapter from the template
3. Wire project-specific truth sources
4. Enable the base Plan → Implement → Verify → Closeout loop
5. Add project-specific skills only after the base is working

**Do not** copy Unit Talk domain logic. See
`install/DO_NOT_COPY_FROM_UNIT_TALK.md`.

## Unit Talk Stability Note

This directory is an **extraction**, not a replacement.

All original Unit Talk docs remain in place at `docs/ai/`. Nothing here modifies
or removes Unit Talk's active AI operating system. The portable core was created
by generalizing the Unit Talk system — the Unit Talk instance remains the
primary example of how this system is used in production.
