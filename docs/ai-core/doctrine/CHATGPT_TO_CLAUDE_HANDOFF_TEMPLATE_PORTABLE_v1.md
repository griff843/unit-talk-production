# ChatGPT → Claude Code Handoff Template — Portable v1

> **Version**: Portable v1 | **Status**: Active **Source**: Extracted from Unit
> Talk ChatGPT → Claude Code Handoff Template v1 **Purpose**: Universal 10-field
> handoff template. Requires zero project adaptation — use as-is.

---

## Purpose

This template standardizes implementation handoffs from ChatGPT reasoning into
Claude Code execution.

A well-formed handoff:

- eliminates ambiguity
- prevents scope creep
- gives Claude Code exactly what it needs to implement correctly on the first
  attempt

Use this template whenever ChatGPT produces an implementation recommendation
that will be executed in Claude Code.

---

## When to Use This Template

| Trigger                                                              | Use handoff template? |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| ChatGPT produced an architecture decision that requires code changes | Yes                   |
| ChatGPT diagnosed an incident and identified a code fix              | Yes                   |
| ChatGPT shaped a sprint and produced a task list                     | Yes                   |
| Simple one-file fix with no architecture ambiguity                   | Optional              |
| Continuing an in-progress sprint (already has context)               | No — use sprint plan  |

---

## Usage Guide

1. **Fill in ChatGPT** — after architecture or diagnosis output, ask ChatGPT to
   populate this template for the implementation it is recommending.
2. **Review before pasting** — check Scope and Non-Goals carefully. Scope creep
   enters here.
3. **Paste into Claude Code** — the filled template becomes the implementation
   prompt.
4. **Claude Code executes** — using the source of truth and constraints defined
   below.
5. **Verify output** — per the Verification Steps and Success Criteria sections.
6. **Route to Claude OS** — if the task changes system behavior, Claude OS
   verification is mandatory before marking complete.

## Template

Copy the block below. Fill all fields. Do not omit fields — a missing field is a
known ambiguity risk.

```markdown
## Handoff: <SPRINT-NAME or short task description>

**Objective** <One sentence: what must be true when this is done?>

**Why It Matters** <One to two sentences: what breaks or degrades if this is not
done? What does this unlock?>

**Scope** <Explicit boundaries of what is included. Name files, subsystems, or
behaviors that are in scope. Be specific.>

**Non-Goals**
<Explicit boundaries of what is NOT included. Name things that may seem related but should not be touched.>

**Source of Truth** <The canonical reference Claude Code must consult before
writing code. Usually: a docs file, an existing implementation pattern, a
governance contract, or a specific file path. Name it explicitly.>

Example: `src/lib/[pattern-module]/` (existing pattern),
`docs/contracts/[CONTRACT].md`

**Constraints / Invariants** <Hard rules that cannot be violated. These
typically come from:

- Project execution contract
- System invariants doc
- Any single-writer or single-authority policy
- Migration or rollback requirements>

Example:

- All [canonical table] writes must go through the designated adapter
- No direct DB writes outside the designated module
- Rollback must be possible for any schema change

**Implementation Tasks** <Numbered, ordered list. Each task should be
completable and verifiable independently.>

1.
2.
3.

**Verification Steps**
<How to confirm the implementation is correct. Include specific commands.>

- [ ] `[type-check command]` passes
- [ ] `[test command]` passes
- [ ] `[project-specific gate]` passes
- [ ] <task-specific behavioral check>

**Output Format** <What should be delivered: diff, file list, proof artifact,
test result, or a specific document?>

**Success Criteria** <Observable, unambiguous conditions that define "done."
Each must be verifiable without human interpretation.>

- <Criterion 1>
- <Criterion 2>
```

## Filled Example (Generic)

```markdown
## Handoff: Add authentication middleware to the admin routes

**Objective** Protect all `/admin/*` routes with JWT verification so
unauthenticated requests are rejected.

**Why It Matters** Admin routes currently have no authentication guard. Any
unauthenticated caller can access admin operations. This is a security gap that
must be closed before the next release.

**Scope**

- `src/routes/admin/` — add auth middleware to all route handlers
- `src/middleware/auth.ts` — create JWT verification middleware
- Unit tests for the middleware

**Non-Goals**

- Do not change the JWT signing logic (not in this sprint)
- Do not touch public routes
- Do not add role-based access control (that is a follow-on sprint)

**Source of Truth**

- Existing auth pattern: `src/lib/auth/` (scan for how tokens are verified
  today)
- Route handler pattern: `src/routes/` (existing handlers show correct
  middleware usage)

**Constraints / Invariants**

- JWT secret must come from environment variables — never hardcoded
- 401 must be returned for missing/invalid tokens (not 403 or 500)
- Middleware must not modify the request body

**Implementation Tasks**

1. Create `src/middleware/auth.ts` with JWT verification
2. Apply middleware to all routes in `src/routes/admin/`
3. Add unit tests for valid token, expired token, and missing token scenarios

**Verification Steps**

- [ ] `npm run type-check` passes
- [ ] `npm run test` passes (including new middleware tests)
- [ ] `curl -X GET /admin/users` without a token returns 401
- [ ] `curl -X GET /admin/users` with a valid token returns 200

**Output Format** Code diffs + test file

**Success Criteria**

- All admin routes return 401 for unauthenticated requests
- All admin routes return correct data for authenticated requests
- New unit tests cover valid, expired, and missing token scenarios
- Type check and test suite pass
```
