# AI Task Routing Matrix — Portable v1

> **Version**: Portable v1 | **Status**: Active **Source**: Extracted from Unit
> Talk AI Task Routing Matrix v1 **Purpose**: Project-agnostic routing
> reference. Adapt by filling `[PROJECT_*]` slots.

## Purpose

Quick-reference routing table for multi-AI workflows.

For any serious task:

1. Identify the closest matching task type
2. Start with the recommended first tool
3. Gather the required context/artifacts
4. Follow the downstream path
5. Ensure Claude OS verification is used where required

If a task is ambiguous or spans multiple categories, default to ChatGPT first.

| Small Low-Risk Mechanical Task      | obvious wording tweak, tiny doc correction, straightforward low-risk edit | Claude Code or ChatGPT | Minimal context, but source of truth still required                          | Direct execution → Claude OS only if governed artifact changes         | Sometimes                    |

## Default Rules

### Rule 1

If you are not sure which row applies, start with ChatGPT.

### Rule 2

If the issue is about current system state, start with MCP/skills.

### Rule 3

If the task is already implementation-ready, start with Claude Code.

### Rule 4

If sprint proof, verification, or closeout quality is the question, start with
Claude OS.

### Rule 5

If architecture or strategy quality matters, use a fresh context bundle first.

---

## Required Artifacts By Task Family

### Architecture / Planning

- Fresh context bundle
- Relevant roadmap/status docs
- Any current architecture constraints

### Diagnosis

- Relevant skill outputs first
- Fresh context bundle if diagnosis requires synthesis
- Explicit problem statement

### Implementation

- Structured implementation prompt
- Source of truth
- Constraints / invariants
- Verification expectations

### Governance

- Sprint artifacts
- Proof bundle
- Closeout documents
- Relevant contracts

### Domain Review

- Fresh context bundle
- Domain artifacts
- `[PROJECT_SPECIFIC_EVIDENCE]` if available

---

## Escalation Rules

### Escalate to ChatGPT when:

- the diagnosis is no longer mechanical
- multiple subsystems are involved
- tradeoffs need to be evaluated
- the implementation path is unclear
- the problem touches architecture, workflow, or long-term maintainability

### Escalate to Claude Code when:

- the fix is implementation-ready
- the required files and constraints are known
- the task is clearly scoped

### Escalate to Claude OS when:

- behavior changed
- verification is needed
- proof is required
- sprint state is changing
- closeout or ratification is needed

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Starting in Claude Code for unresolved architecture questions
- Starting in ChatGPT for a live-system issue without skill outputs
- Treating implementation as complete before Claude OS verification
- Asking for strategy/domain guidance without a fresh context bundle
- Mixing diagnosis, implementation, and governance into one vague request

---

## Mental Model Shortcut

- **Static reasoning** → context bundle → ChatGPT
- **Dynamic system truth** → MCP/skills first
- **Scoped repo execution** → Claude Code
- **Verification / proof / closeout** → Claude OS

---

## Adaptation Instructions

When installing this matrix in a new project:

1. Replace `[PROJECT_DOMAIN]` rows with your project's domain-specific diagnosis
   scenarios
2. Replace `[PROJECT_DOC_ROOT]` with your actual doc path
3. Replace `[PROJECT_SPECIFIC_EVIDENCE]` with your project's evidence sources
4. Keep all generic rows as-is — they apply to every project
5. Remove this section when done adapting
