# Do Not Copy These From Unit Talk

**Version:** v1 | **Date:** 2026-03-16

---

## Purpose

This document is explicit about what should NOT be copied from Unit Talk into a
new project.

The risk of copying Unit Talk-specific assets into an unrelated project is real:

- You inherit betting-domain logic that has no meaning elsewhere
- Helpers and hooks start hardcoding wrong assumptions
- The project adapter becomes secretly Unit Talk-shaped
- Future diagnosis fails because the wrong skills are installed

## DO NOT Copy These Files

### Skills — Unit Talk-Specific

These skills are directly tied to Unit Talk's domain logic. They have no
portable meaning.

| File                                      | Why Not Portable                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.claude/skills/pick-trace.md`            | Traces a pick through the `unified_picks` lifecycle. Meaningless outside Unit Talk. |
| `.claude/skills/edge-check.md`            | CLV edge and model calibration for betting intelligence. Betting-domain logic.      |
| `.claude/skills/grading-audit.md`         | Audits the scoring/grading layer of the betting system.                             |
| `.claude/skills/intelligence-analysis.md` | Reviews CLV, calibration, and risk metrics for betting.                             |
| `.claude/skills/lifecycle-diagnose.md`    | Diagnoses `unified_picks` lifecycle state transitions.                              |
| `.claude/skills/risk-policy.md`           | Enforces Unit Talk's market-type exposure caps.                                     |
| `.claude/skills/settlement-integrity.md`  | Checks pick settlement records. Betting-settlement specific.                        |
| `.claude/skills/single_writer_audit.md`   | Audits compliance with Unit Talk's single-writer constraint for `unified_picks`.    |

**What to do instead:** Build health-check and diagnostic skills from scratch
for your project, using the pattern from `pipeline-health.md` or `slo-report.md`
but targeting your project's actual data sources.

### Application Code

Never copy Unit Talk application code into another project as a starting point.

| Module                         | Why Not Portable                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `apps/api/src/lib/lifecycle/`  | The lifecycle adapter pattern is UT-specific (unified_picks, writerRole, atomicClaimForPost).          |
| `apps/api/src/agents/`         | UT agents (GradingAgent, DiscordPromotionAgent, etc.) are betting-domain specific.                     |
| `packages/mcp-*`               | MCP packages expose UT-specific truth surfaces (unified_picks, bridge_outbox, agent_health).           |
| Database migrations            | All migrations target UT's specific schema (unified_picks, participants, prop_settlements, etc.).      |
| `CLAUDE_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md` | Contains UT-specific single-writer rules, lifecycle adapter requirements, and table-specific policies. |

### Governance Contracts — Unit Talk-Specific Sections

These governance docs contain sections that are Unit Talk-specific and should
not be copied verbatim:

| File                                                | What Not To Copy                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CLAUDE.md`                                         | Single-writer policy (§4), canonical tables (§3), lifecycle adapter examples. These are UT-specific. Copy the workflow structure (phases, proof requirements) not the content. |
| `.claude/rules/02-db-migrations.md`                 | References UT-specific immutability triggers and Supabase constraints.                                                                                                         |
| `.claude/rules/03-single-writer-and-idempotency.md` | Entirely about `unified_picks` single-writer discipline.                                                                                                                       |

**What to do instead:** Create your own CLAUDE.md from scratch, referencing the
pattern but using your project's actual tables, constraints, and invariants.

## The Test

Before copying any Unit Talk asset into another repo, ask:

> "Would this make sense if the project had nothing to do with sports betting,
> Discord bots, or pick lifecycle management?"

If no, do not copy it.
