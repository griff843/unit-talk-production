# ADR 001: Agent-Based Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Unit Talk needs a scalable, maintainable architecture for handling complex sports betting operations including pick grading, data processing, and contest management. The system needs to:

- Handle high throughput of betting picks and market data
- Provide real-time grading and analysis
- Support complex business rules and scoring logic
- Scale horizontally for increased load
- Maintain high availability and fault tolerance
- Enable easy addition of new features and capabilities

## Decision
We will implement an agent-based architecture where each major system capability is implemented as an independent agent. Each agent will:

1. Extend a common `BaseAgent` class that provides:
   - Standardized lifecycle management
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Metrics and monitoring
   - Health checks
   - Configuration management

2. Follow event-driven patterns:
   - Communicate via well-defined events
   - Use message queues for asynchronous processing
   - Implement dead letter queues for failed operations

3. Implement domain-specific logic:
   - Encapsulate business rules
   - Manage its own data models
   - Handle domain-specific validation
   - Provide specialized metrics

4. Core agents will include:
   - GradingAgent: Pick evaluation and classification
   - DataAgent: ETL and data quality
   - ContestAgent: Contest lifecycle and rules

## Consequences

### Advantages
1. **Modularity**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Independent scaling and deployment
   - Easier testing and maintenance

2. **Reliability**
   - Isolated failure domains
   - Built-in retry mechanisms
   - Comprehensive monitoring

3. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling per agent
   - Independent resource allocation
   - Load balancing flexibility

4. **Extensibility**
   - Easy to add new agents
   - Standardized integration patterns
   - Reusable base functionality

### Challenges
1. **Complexity**
   - More moving parts to manage
   - Need for robust orchestration
   - Complex deployment topology

2. **Consistency**
   - Event ordering guarantees
   - Distributed state management
   - Transaction boundaries

3. **Operations**
   - Multiple services to monitor
   - Complex debugging scenarios
   - Resource overhead

## Implementation

### BaseAgent Structure
```typescript
abstract class BaseAgent {
  // Lifecycle
  initialize(): Promise<void>
  start(): Promise<void>
  stop(): Promise<void>

  // Error Handling
  handleError(error: Error): Promise<void>
  retryOperation<T>(op: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>

  // Monitoring
  reportMetrics(): Promise<void>
  checkHealth(): Promise<HealthStatus>

  // Abstract Methods
  abstract processMessage(msg: Message): Promise<void>
  abstract validateConfig(): Promise<void>
}
```

### Event System
```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string
  type: string
  source: string
  timestamp: string
  data: unknown
}

interface EventBus {
  publish(event: Event): Promise<void>
  subscribe(pattern: string, handler: (event: Event) => Promise<void>): void
}
```

### Configuration
```typescript
interface AgentConfig {
  id: string
  version: string
  enabled: boolean
  retryConfig: {
    maxAttempts: number
    backoffMs: number
  }
  metricsConfig: {
    port: number
    path: string
  }
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Implement BaseAgent framework
2. Set up monitoring infrastructure
3. Create core event system

### Phase 2: Core Agents
1. Migrate GradingAgent
2. Implement DataAgent
3. Add ContestAgent

### Phase 3: Enhancement
1. Add advanced features
2. Optimize performance
3. Enhance monitoring

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture
- Simpler deployment
- Easier transactions
- Less operational overhead
- Rejected due to scaling limitations

### Microservices
- More granular scaling
- Technology diversity
- Higher complexity
- Rejected due to operational overhead

### Serverless
- Auto-scaling
- Pay-per-use
- Limited control
- Rejected due to cold starts and cost
