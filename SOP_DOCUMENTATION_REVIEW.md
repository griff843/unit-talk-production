# Unit Talk Production ‚Äì SOP & Documentation Review  
*(Version 2025-06-19 ‚Äì Pre-launch QA)*  

---

## 1. Executive Summary  

The current documentation set ‚Äì found primarily in `/docs`, root-level `*_SUMMARY.md` files, and scattered READMEs ‚Äì covers ~70 % of the platform‚Äôs surface area. Core architectural concepts, agent-development workflow, and generic operational SOPs are solid, but **critical run-time details, environment variable matrices, and Temporal-workflow guidance are incomplete or stale.**  
A focused documentation sprint is required to hit Fortune-100 onboarding and audit standards before launch.

## 3. Gap Analysis by Domain  

### 3.1 Core Architecture & Temporal  
* No end-to-end diagram showing Temporal worker, workflow proxies, activity scheduling.  
* Absence of a **Temporal Operations SOP** (starting worker, viewing UI, replaying failed workflows, executing ‚Äúcancel / terminate / reset‚Äù).  
* Health-check SOP lacks Temporal service-down scenario.

### 3.2 Agents  
| Agent | Existing Doc | Gaps Identified |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| GradingAgent | None | Tier thresholds, EdgeScoring versioning, env vars (`EDGE_CONFIG_*`) |
| AlertAgent | None | Rate-limit tuning, LLM cost guardrails, multi-channel flow |
| IngestionAgent | None | SGO polling cadence, duplicate-hash algorithm, supabase schema |
| NotificationAgent | None | Channel matrix, fail-over order, Twilio/SMS env vars |
| FeedAgent & DataAgent | None | Provider contract, normalization fields |
| RecapAgent | ‚úÖ deployment guide | Add Temporal cron usage, micro-recap cooldown persistence |
* **Action**: produce ‚ÄúAgent Runbook‚Äù template & instantiate per agent.

### 3.3 Integrations  
* External Integration SOP omits **Supabase role setup**, **SGO API key rotation**, **OpenAI usage limits**.  
* No document explains **Retool dashboard architecture** (tables, queries, secret storage).  
* Missing **Discord permission model** & rate-limit table.

### 3.4 Infrastructure / DevOps  
* CI/CD narrative in Upgrade SOP predates migration to GitHub Actions matrix; needs update.  
* `.droid.yaml` review-guideline doc not included ‚Äì add pointer.  
* Husky install deprecation flagged in build output; SOP must reflect new pre-commit strategy.

### 3.5 KPIs & Monitoring  
* KPI SOP lists categories but not concrete **Prometheus metric ‚ûú Grafana panel ‚ûú Stakeholder** mapping.  
* Alert latency, Grading accuracy, Tier ROI have metric names in code (`alert_processing_time_ms`, etc.) but are undocumented.  
* No **SLO/SLA doc** (acceptable error rates, latency thresholds).

### 3.6 Incident Response & Runbooks  
* Recovery SOP thorough but lacks:  
  * **Temporal stuck workflow** playbook  
  * **Supabase permission outage** steps  
  * **LLM quota exhaustion** mitigation

## 5. Suggested Structural Changes  

1. **/docs/agents/** ‚Äì dedicated folder per agent (`grading.md`, `alert.md`, ‚Ä¶).  
2. **/docs/integrations/** ‚Äì one file per external system.  
3. **/docs/ops/** ‚Äì temporal-operations, incident-response, health-check, upgrade-automation.  
4. Embed **Mermaid or SVG** diagrams for architecture (supported by GitHub & Notion).  

---

## 6. Documentation Quality Checklist (post-sprint)  

- [ ] Every agent has Runbook (purpose, lifecycle, env vars, KPIs, maintenance).  
- [ ] README includes quick-start + system diagram.  
- [ ] `.env.example` exhaustive & validated by `config/env.ts` schema.  
- [ ] SOPs reflect actual CI/CD tooling (GitHub Actions, ECR, k8s).  
- [ ] KPI SOP maps every Prometheus metric ‚Üí dashboard panel.  
- [ ] Temporal Operations SOP tested by new engineer.  
- [ ] Incident & Recovery SOP includes LLM quota and Supabase outage scenarios.  
- [ ] Archive folder stores historical design docs to reduce root clutter.

## 7. Conclusion  

Documentation maturity is **medium-high** but not yet **Fortune-100 audit-ready**. Completing the roadmap will:

* Reduce onboarding time for engineers and VAs.  
* Meet external investor diligence requirements.  
* Minimize operational risk during first production incidents.  

**Blocking for launch?**  
*Docs alone won‚Äôt block launch, but lack of Temporal & env guidance could hinder on-call recovery and investor demo. Completing P0 items is strongly recommended before inviting high-value users.*  

*Prepared by Factory.ai Documentation Audit ‚Äì 2025-06-19*
