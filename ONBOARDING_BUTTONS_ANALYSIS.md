## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### **Priority 1: Fix Broken User Experience**
The current system sends users professional onboarding messages with buttons that don't work. This creates a poor user experience and reflects badly on the platform.

### **Priority 2: Implement Capper Flow First**
Cappers are likely the most important user type for the platform's success. Their onboarding should be the first priority.

### **Priority 3: Create Scalable System**
Build the button handler system in a way that can easily accommodate all user types and future expansion.
